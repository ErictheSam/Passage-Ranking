# Passage-Ranking
  
## Introduction
This is the final project in artificial neural network.
We use bert and GAT to train a passage ranking model on MS Marco dataset.
  
## Architecture
We incorporated BERT, a potent model in providing context-based representation of words, as well as GAT, a novel GNN model, to obtain augmented entity embedding. We also add a local model for exact word match in order to enhance the model's ability confronting rare words.

## Result
Unfortunately, due to the limitation in time and device, we haven't acquired a final result.
